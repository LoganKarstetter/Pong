# Pong
A two-player Pong game I created in January of 2018. The left paddle is controlled with the A and Z keys, the right paddle is controlled with the K and M keys, and the ESC key quits the game. A single command line argument (integer value) can be passed to set the FPS for the game (it runs at 20 FPS by default). The first player to score five times wins!
